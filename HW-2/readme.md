Discuss your progress this week with the introduction to JS and your console example

Regarding my progress with javascript this week, I believe I have done so-so. Learning a
new language has not been too easy, yet after going through codecademy I have found that
I can make sense of it a bit more. I am still in the beginning stages of addressing the
homework assignment; however, in the process of it I am seeing that I cannot find the
javascript -hello world content.

Overall, I believe that I will need to do more research with the downloadable PDF book to
gather more information to further my understanding. In addition, I believe it would be wise
if I use the discord website to post where I am at with my homework assignment issue, which is
not being able to see the -hello world content and not seeing the blue background.
