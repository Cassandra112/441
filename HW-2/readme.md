441 HW-2 Readme


Regarding my progress with javascript this week, I believe I have done so-so. Learning a
new language has not been too easy, yet after going through codecademy I have found that
I can make sense of it a bit more. I am still in the beginning stages of addressing the
homework assignment; however, in the process of it I am seeing that I cannot find the
javascript -hello world content in Google Chrome. Yet, I can view it in Safari, so I am
wondering if it is there and I just cannot locate it. On a positive note, I can see the
blue background, and I am super excited about that! I see the progress and am grateful
for that.

Overall, I believe that I will need to do more research with the downloadable PDF book to
gather more information to further my understanding. In addition, I believe it would be wise
if I use the discord website to post where I am at with my homework assignment issue(s), which is
not being able to see the -hello world content in Google Chrome.
