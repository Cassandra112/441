This week's material was content that I was able to follow pretty well. It seems as the weeks pass that the
work is sinking in and I am grasping more of it each week. I can absolutely say that I am getting more
familiar with CSS once again. I have enjoyed using CSS in the past and being able to go through the process
again is enlightening. I wish that I could spend more time updating and modifying the imagery of the work
that I have done; however, I have not yet gotten to that point. Furthermore, I feel more confident with
using the 'developer tools' and console information. This has proven to be a great tool to find which
areas are not processing correctly. I am happy to say that it used it so much for this week's homework
and I feel glad that I was able to use it and be successful in addressing issues by the insight it
provided for my assignment. Finally, working in Javascript is coming in with more ease. I felt like
I was in the shadows with this foreign language and I was pretty stressed out with it. Now, I have greater
insight and understanding as the class continues. I am really glad and thankful for sticking with this course
as I had a lot of worry and doubts at the beginning of the course.
