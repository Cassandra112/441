This weeks homework was a great way to learn how to alternate images from using a button. This feature is really neat. However, I am still working through how to do it. It is neat how you can change the data / information from just a click of the button. Adding information to a class with limited
information that is able to pull information in another function is quite interesting as well. Getting onto websites and using these features / functions and not knowing how it really works is something, I feel, I have taken for granted. Why? Because there is a lot of work involved. Although I could not tie my images into alternating. I am going to see if I can make some minor adjustments on my end later. Lastly, one of my regrets is not
fully remembering css fully. I really enjoyed working and learning css and html when I took another class; however, tying in both has been a challenge.

I hope that I can tie in more CSS features / elements into future assignments.
