441 HW-1 Readme

This week and assignment is upsetting because of several reasons. It is difficult due to the
fact that I have to go back and do a refresher course on the material that I learned in my
web development course, which was a whole semester long. I wish I could say that I am looking forward to refreshing my
memory on this material, however, at this point -I am not. On another note, I have used Github
for a previous course and when I initially logged in,  I logged into the older account that
was not linked correctly, I believe, as github informed me that I needed to 'fork' the
data together. Because of this, I ended up starting from scratch by deleting the data / homework I had
worked on. Then I used the correct account that is connected to my github and atom account, which produced a
seamless process. Backtracking was not fun at all, and it was time consuming. I am glad to say that I was able to connect
the right account and there was no reason for me to 'fork' any type of data. On a positive note, the zip download
helped a great deal. I was able to see what is expected and build off what I seen.
