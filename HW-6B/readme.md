This week's homework has been challenging, yet rewarding. I found that I am still understanding how functions tie into each other
and their output. It is something that I hope to understand more fully as the course continues. The JSON material that we covered is
pretty different. The local storage insight seemed to make a little more sense, yet this language is still making its way towards
me understanding it fully.
