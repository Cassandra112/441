HW-3

In this week some of the challenges I faced was simply trying to understand the overall language and process.
After going through the course website, I gained more of an understanding of the process. The external websites
were a bonus as I ran through the examples and prompts. One of the biggest challenges that I have faced is simply
getting back on board with CSS. In order to try to understand it again, I went to my previous files / projects in
github to review. This has been such a great help and I am so glad I have them still!
