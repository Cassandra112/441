    <p>I am a student at the University of Montana. Presently, I work in printing and produce various types
      of material that is used for marketing and education. I am familiar with designing various types of
      signage, collages, photo enhancements, and more. Additionally, I have worked in sound design and
      creating short videos within the Adobe Suite. Upon graduating, I plan on utilizing my skill set in
      the field that I work in and in any future fields I will work in.</p>

      <p>I believe that the work that I create has classic elements to it. I would describe classic as reflecting
        strong and sharp colors, serif type fonts, and images and videos that are crisp and clean. I believe that
        these elements that I incorporate to my work can be seen as unique and can capture audiences who value
        and appreciate this feel and look.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Finally, I hope that while working within this course it will enhance my skills at a greater and stronger level.</p>
