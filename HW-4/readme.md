HW-4

This week has been quite interesting. The content within the course website seemed to all come together a little bit more clearer.
At first, a lot of the js material seemed like I was trying to read Greek, mostly. Now, it is making more sense. For myself, the videos
at the end of each section seem to assist me a lot more then some of the other guided material / sites that I have gone on. I believe
that has to do with me being more of a visual learner. Either way, I am still in the process of really understanding the functions and the variables.
One thing that seems to get me is -how can I name functions or variables. Are there set names? Are all function and label names made up and so forth?
For some reason or another, I keep reverting back to the CSS language. I know their heading codes, title code, the style code, the body code...to me
all these are standard, yet I am confident in using them. I am staying positive that this will all sink in soon.

On another note, I went in and did a copy and paste for my HW-4 homework files / folder. I am now adding and modifying the content within this week's
homework.
